# Example YAML configuration for the sidecar pattern.

# It defines a main application container which writes
# the current date to a log file every five seconds.

# The sidecar container is nginx serving that log file.
# (In practice, your sidecar is likely to be a log collection
# container that uploads to external storage.)

# To run:
#   kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

# Once the pod is running:
#   
#   (Connect to the sidecar pod)
#   kubectl exec pod-with-sidecar -c sidecar-container -it bash
#   
#   (Install curl on the sidecar)
#   apt-get update && apt-get install curl
#   
#   (Access the log file via the sidecar)
#   curl 'http://localhost:80/app.txt'
