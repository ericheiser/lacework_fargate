Deploying a workload to EKS Fargate

1) Deploy an EKS Fargate Cluster
-- Make sure you use the same creds throughout (either setup CLI w/ Okta, or use CLI/IAM User).  If you DONT, you will have a real pain in the ass time in authenticating to your cluster.

- install eksctl (insert docs)


command `eksctl create cluster  --name galen-eksfargate --region us-west-2 --fargate`

Installation Verification:
`kubectl get nodes -o wide` 

you should see your fargate nodes.

`kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide`

you should see some default amazon pods like coredns, etc.

Once you have the cluster up, you can either validate deployments by deploying a simple workload to the system.  In this repository, that would be the `sample_service.yaml`.

In order to take a workload and run the lacework datacollector inside of it, three modifications need to happen **PER POD**.

They are in short:
* VolumeMount a shared empty directory to pass files back and forth
* the lacework datacollector as an initcontainer
* run the lacework.sh startup script that runs the datacollector, and then runs the workload's application.
